## Summary

One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that inputting the text parameters for the search has to match exactly the requirements for inputting the correct syntax.  For example it is recommended that for state filter, that a user can type in and search with the entire state name rather than just the abbreviation.  Also, when inputting the syntax for shape, some shapes are not available and the user may not know what shapes are available.  For the shape criteria, maybe have a pull down list of shapes to select from.
